A Propositional Logic Argument Tester
Propositional Logic Argument Validity Tester. Accepts one or more premises and an optional conclusion in the 
formal language of propositional, or sentential, logic. Reports if the set of premises entail the conclusion 
and, therefore, if the argument is valid, or has good logical form.

Many of the functions are compatible with other, more expressive logics. I plan on creating future projects 
to test arguments written in the formal languages of S5 Modal Logic, Predicate Logic, Relational logic with 
identity, etc.
